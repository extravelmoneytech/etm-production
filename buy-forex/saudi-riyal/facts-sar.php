                    Saudi Riyal is the official currency of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The currency is
                    represented by the symbol SR or ر.س and by the ISO code SAR. The currency is
                    subdivided into 100 Halalah. The banknotes and coins are issued by the Saudi Arabian
                    Monetary Authority. The banknotes range from 5 to 500 riyals and coins from 1 to 50
                    halalahs and 1, 2 riyals are issued by the Saudi Arabian Monetary Authority. The
                    Saudi Riyal has an exchange value of 15-20 Indian Rupees. The Saudi Riyal is popular
                    in India due to a large number of NRI citizens working in Saudi Arabia. Since there
                    are not many skilled Saudi citizens contributing to the labour force. The majority
                    of the foreign workers in Saudi Arabia is from India. Hence the Indian banks and
                    exchange houses accept and exchange Saudi Riyal.
