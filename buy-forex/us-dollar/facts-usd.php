                    <li> The lower right corner of the circulating notes has the numeral printed with color-changing
                        ink. While tilting a real note, the color changes from copper to green.</li>

                    <li>A watermark and security thread are present in denominations higher than five. While exposed
                        to light, these unique identifiers will appear on both sides of a genuine note.</li>

                    <li>Portraits, borders, Federal Reserve, and Treasury seals on authentic notes are sharp and
                        well-defined. These elements shall be blurred and dull in case of fake notes.</li>

                    <li>Original notes have minute red and blue fibers embedded in them. While closely observing
                        counterfeit notes, these colors are either printed or drawn, which looks distinctively
                        different from genuine notes.</li>

                    <li>The composition of the paper and ink used in US dollar notes are confidential. Authentic
                        notes are rough and raised in texture, unlike fake currency notes that are smooth.</li>

                    <li>The serial numbers on the original notes are well-aligned and adequately spaced. Compare and
                        analyze the spacing of the doubtful note with a genuine one.</li>
