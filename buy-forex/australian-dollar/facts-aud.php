                                    The Australian dollar is the authorized currency of Australia, which is among the
                                    top ten currencies traded in the forex market. The symbol $ and the code AUD denote
                                    the Australian dollar. It is also nicknamed Dough and Aussie Dollar. The Reserve
                                    Bank of Australia is responsible for issuing Australian dollars and the minor units
                                    called cents. Australia is one of the wealthiest countries in economy, natural
                                    resources, and infrastructure. These tempting characteristics of Australia attract
                                    multinational tourists, immigrants, and students. Therefore, a high demand for
                                    Australian dollars is present in the current scenario. ExTravelMoney facilitates
                                    sales and purchases of genuine Australian dollars that efficiently cover your

                                    <li>Since Australian dollars are polymer in material, an authentic note returns to
                                        its original shape without creases after being crumpled.</li>
                                    <li>The dark-colored portraits and numerals on a banknote are slightly raised, with
                                        a different texture, which can be sensed by touch.</li>
                                    <li>When tilted, the seven-pointed star, part of the top-to-bottom window on an
                                        actual currency, shall turn three-dimensional, colorful, and raised. On the
                                        other hand, the seven-pointed star in the small window in the lower corner
                                        appears to have a light and dark effect.</li>
                                    <li>An original note has an image of a flying dollar bird that moves its wings and
                                        changes color when looked at from a different angle. Another dollar bird in
                                        resting position is present that shifts color.</li>
                                    <li>A numeral, which is present on a building, disappears and further changes to
                                        reverse order while tilting a genuine banknote.</li>
                                    <li>An authentic note has an evident patch on the top corner of one side that
                                        appears as a bird-like image on the other side. Both these images possess a
                                        rolling-color effect.</li>
                                    <li>Multi-colored background prints and micro printings are present on authorized
                                        currencies. Even though these prints are minute, they are sharp and clear.
                                        Therefore, check for irregularities and color differences to authenticate.</li>
