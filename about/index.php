            <p class="paraText">ExTravelMoney is an online marketplace for foreign exchange and remittance services in
                India. We empower students and travellers going abroad to make the Right and the Best choice when it

        <div>
            <h1 class="titleText">Our Story </h1>
            <p class="paraText"> ExTravelMoney was started in 2015 with the goal to simplify the process of searching
                for
                best rate foreign exchange services offered by RBI licenced banks and money changers. Also, we wanted to
                enable people to book these services online itself from the comfort of their home or office.
            </p>
            <p class="paraText">
                Our small initiative has now blossomed into the biggest online marketplace for forex services in India.
                We now boast a network strength of 6500+ partnered forex stores across the length and breadth of India.

            <p class="paraText"> For us, our satisfaction lies in making sure customers get the best exchange rate for
                their
                forex requirement. At the end of each forex transaction, we want customers to say “ExTravelMoney gave me
                the
                best rate and the process was easier than visiting my bank”. That is music to our ears. Our well-trained
                customer support staff are instructed to do just this. They’ll guide you by suggesting the most
                wallet-friendly forex option and help you with the RBI compliant documentation for the same.
