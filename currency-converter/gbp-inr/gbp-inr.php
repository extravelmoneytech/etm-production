                        British Pounds Sterling
                        The British Pound Sterling is the official currency of the United Kingdom and many other
                        territories. The British Pounds is one of the oldest currencies in the world that still exists.
                        The British Pound is represented by the symbol £ and by the ISO code GBP. One Pound is
                        subdivided into 100 Pence. The Sterling Pound banknotes and coins are issued by the Bank of
                        England. The banknotes issued ranges from £1 to £50 and coins issued ranges from 1p to 50p and
                        £1 to £5. The British Pound Sterling has an exchange value of 80-100 Indian Rupee. Find the live

                        The United Kingdom is one of the oldest monarchs in the world and is one of the few countries
                        that still follow such a system of administration. The British had influence in every continent
                        of the world due to the extensive colonization implemented by the British in the past. The
                        revenue from the colonies was the key factor that fuelled the British economy during that time.
                        But the world wars and British colonies gaining independence dimmed the British economy. Now the
                        economy is maintained mainly through foreign trade relations and through the petroleum industry.
                        Similar to GBP the British Pounds is also one of the most traded currency in the world. Since
                        the Pound Sterling is the official currency in a lot of territories and countries other than
                        Britain, the currency has a global value.
